This simulation platform was developed during the PhD of Guilhem Mariotte. It also received contributions from the PhD thesis of SÃ©rgio F. A. Batista for the traffic assignment part. It is one of the outcomes of the [MAGnUM project](https://magnum-erc.weebly.com/), held by Prof. Ludovic Leclercq and funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 646592).

Designing a simulation
----------------------
In your network folder in the `UserNetworks/` directory, create or edit the scripts `SimulSettings.m` (global settings of the simulation, i.e. duration, timestep, assignment, etc), `ResDef.m` (characteristics of the reservoirs), `DemDef.m` (definition of the macroscopic OD matrix).

Launching a simulation
----------------------
Specify the network, the solver and the name of the output file in the script `Main.m`. Run this script for a classical simulation (with eventually DTA) in the main SymuRes directory. The output of the simulation is always saved into the `outputs/` folder in the corresponding network folder.

Plotting the results of a simulation
------------------------------------
Specify the simulation outputs to load at the beginning of the script `scrPlotResults.m`. Several simulations can be loaded at the same time. Run parts of this script to plot the desired results (accumulations, flows, N-curves, travel times, etc). For each plot script, indicate the relevant list of simulation results, reservoirs, routes to compare.
